so basically i was so bored i wanted to make a website for youth taraweeh for like selecting slots for pages so people dont argue

mainly html css javascript frontend with a php mysql backend

i have now uploadeded it @ http://youthtaraweeh.byethost3.com/

/main is my first attempt but i didnt like the design so i started over. basically used that as a learning experience
/real is the real deal

my database files [/real/sql.php,selectconnection.php (basically the same as sql.php i made two different files by accident lol), and /main/database.php are just local stuff i didnt upload the actual server name password etc.

yeah thats it
